To connect to the Twitter API, we need the following credentials:

1. TWITTER_API_KEY - The API Key (Consumer Key) from your Twitter Developer account
2. TWITTER_API_SECRET - The API Secret (Consumer Secret) from your Twitter Developer account
3. TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN - The Access Token for your Twitter account
4. TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET - The Access Token Secret for your Twitter account

You can obtain these from the Twitter Developer Portal (https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
by creating a new project and app with Read and Write permissions.
